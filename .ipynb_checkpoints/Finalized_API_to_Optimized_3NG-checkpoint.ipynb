    "# NBA Project Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "This NBA data science project was inspired by wanting to optimize court spacing. The NBA today is heavily reliant on 3 point shooters with 5 man units often deploying 5 players who can shoot well. We believe that the next step may be to find where players take shots from in order to maximize each players shooting strengths and minimized their weaknesses. All data is downloaded from the NBA API. Player data downloaded from the NBA API is used to generate court area specific data of players shooting abilities. In specific, the 3NG (3 net gain) metric was used in order to assess 3 point shooting. 3NG is a comprehensive 3 point shooting metric that takes into account a players shooting percentages as well as the volume at which they shoot. We believed it was important to assess the fundamental problem if a 40% shooter who shoots 2 3s a game is better or worse than a 38% shooter who shoots 8 times a game. 3NG calculated values for players are used in order to generate an optimized court spacing for any given 5 man unit."

The formula for 3NG is 3NG = 3P * 1.94 - 3Mi * 1.06. 1.06 represents the average amount of points scored per possession in the NBA over the last 20 years, while 1.94 refers to the value added over 1.06 by making a 3 (3 - 1.06 = 1.94). 3P corresponds to made 3s and 3Mi corresponds to missed threes. 3NG is then divided by games played in order to get a 3NG per game metric. find_all_3NG calculates 3NG values for players at all 5 defined positions behind the 3 point line. A players total 3NG can be found by adding these if so desired."

It outputs a dictionary with keys of player names and values of the area that the player should stand in. Each player has a unique area. The function takes in a 5 x 5 numpy array and outputs the maximum possible 3NG sum that can be made, with constraints that 3NG values in the final output cannot come from the same player and cannot come from the same shot location. The solving of this problem utilizes an algorithm that is used in the classic Assignment problem. "
